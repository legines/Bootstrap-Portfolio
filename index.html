        <p>Growing up I loved computers so much that I would spend endless hours learning and customizing my prebuilt Dell PCâ€™s. I learned HTML and built very basic websites using HTML and Dreamweaver for my own entertainment. Eventually my interests in computers led me to build my own PC. I always wanted to learn to code as a career, but was afraid that pursuing something that my younger self considered a hobby would lead to me eventually hating it. In college I chose to explore my interests in science and majored in Biochemistry at North Carolina State University. I love everything about Biochemistry. The complexity, the knowledge of the inner mechanisms of life, and the difficulty. With this degree I have been able to work with infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis C. Currently, I conduct chromosome analysis on patient peripheral blood looking for abnormalities and accurately diagnosing those patients. However, I took one statistical programming class using SAS and my desire to code returned. Im grateful that I have a wonderful girlfriend that introduced me to this program and pushed me to pursue a new career path.</p>
        <br>
        <p> In my free time I like to lift, work on cars, read Sci-fi, and occasionally game. Most of my childhood was spent playing competitive Counter Strike and attending LAN tournaments. 90's Hip-Hop is my favorite genre of music, although I also listen to deep house, alternative/indie rock, mathcore (The Fall of Troy), and the occasional trap music. My favorite books are the Dune and Expanse series. I recommend that everyone even remotely interested in sci-fi read these books and thank me later. I hope to one day figure out what that squeaking in the rear suspension of my car is before I go mad, take my car out to learn to drift, and get my hands on a 1970-1972 240z.</p>
