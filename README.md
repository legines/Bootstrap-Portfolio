# Bootstrap-Portfolio

1. Using Bootstrap, recreatec my basic portfolio site with the following items:  

    * A navbar.

    * A responsive layout.

    * eg. On xs and sm screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On m and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid.
  
    * Responsive images.

1. BONUS: Using Bootstrap, I made a sticky footer and used sub-rows and sub-solumns. 

1. Minimized the use of media queries.
